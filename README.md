# Build-Processor-from-scratch

This project presents a simple processor design implemented in Verilog. The processor supports a basic instruction set architecture (ISA) capable of executing arithmetic, logical, memory, and branching operations. The design includes an instruction fetch, decode, along with condition flags and a finite state machine (FSM) for control.
